# Accounts Follow Up

## About

This is a simple app project that allows to keep tracks of your bank accounts.
I'm doing it because online bank sites takes forever to show the transactions,
so I began to note every transactions I made on a paper, but I always lost it.
So then I decided to build an app for this.
It is not automated though, you'll have to enter each transactions by hand.
It is not builded in order to replace any bank app or whatever.
